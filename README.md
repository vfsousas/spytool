# Spy Tool for pywinauto

## Review

Due to the lack of good analyzers for screen elements for windows applications, this project brings a new approach so that new features and development are customized in order to create good screen analyzers

---

## The structure

This projects was build using pywinauto to get all windows elements, for the UI is used the lib PySimpleGUI and PyGame (used only to create a rectangle in the screen)
