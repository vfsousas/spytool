# Spy Tool for pywinauto

## Review
Due to the lack of good analyzers for screen elements for windows applications, this project brings a new approach so that new features and development are customized in order to create good screen analyzers

## The structure
This projects was build using pywinauto to get all windows elements, for the UI is used the lib PySimpleGUI and PyGame (used only to create a rectangle in the screen)
